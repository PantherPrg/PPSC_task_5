**Use 3.14 as pi and round your answer to the tenth. do not round elsewhere.*

**Output**:
Return a float as a string of the area of the pizza and make sure to add a newline at the end of your returned answer. This is needed to match the format for the task result.

This problem deals with variable calculations, datatype casting, float rounding, and simple math. 

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. If multiple people have the same obstacles, we would be able to go over them during the club. 

Otherwise, you can use https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp for datatype casting, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19431674/rounding-floats-to-nearest-10th (a stackoverflow thread) for rounding.
